- with a regex filter applied scrolling doesn't make sense
 + rethink how regex_index stores it's matches
 + when scrolling down or up, we need to find the next line that is above or below and matching

- test UTF8
- make tab width configurable
- use color
- cache regular expression containers
- support cursor in line_edit()
- write man page
