- with a regex filter applied scrolling doesn't make sense
 + rethink how regex_index stores it's matches
 + when scrolling down or up, we need to find the next line that is above or below and matching
 + have global vector of line numbers which are displayed
 + write apply_regex() which configures the global vector of line numbers

- configure tab width from command line
- read tab width from vim/emacs comments

- preconfigure filter and display regex and search strings from command line
- when exiting, write command line to restore regex and search strings

- when starting, only parse the first screen height lines from the file and display them
 + then parse the remaining lines in a background thread
- when adding a regex, let it run in a background thread and apply once done

- modify how lines are displayed with regex
- test UTF8
- use color
- cache regular expression containers
- support cursor in line_edit()
- write man page
